# Coderbyte Challenges
My solutions for coding challenges on Coderbyte in javascript.

A list of challenges in order:

1- First Factorial

2- First Reverse ** I used "array.reduce(reducingFunction)" and "...array" operator for the first time.

3- Letter Changes

4- Simple Adding

5- Letter Capitalize ** I used RegEx for the first time.

6- Simple Symbols ** It was painful. https://regexr.com/ is pretty useful.

7- Check Nums

8- Time Convert

9- Alphabet Soup ** I used array.sort(func(a,b)) for the first time.

10- Kaprekars Constant
